## Introduction
While developing the project, I wanted not only to meet the objectives, but also to expand the project to a state where it could be fully used in real life. 
For this reason, the description of the project below will not be limited to the list of required functionality and a few features that I made.
I went further and divided the project into modules, so as not to miss all the details and describe the functionality in as much detail as possible.

## Required functionality
1. <span id="reqf_1"></span> There is a list of Cars in the system, for which it is necessary to implement: 
   - choice by brand; 
   - choice according to quality class; 
   - sort by rental price; 
   - sort by name.

2. <span id="reqf_2"></span>The customer registers in the system, chooses a car and makes a rental order.

3. <span id="reqf_3"></span> An unregistered customer cannot place an order.

4. <span id="reqf_4"></span> In the order data the client indicates passport data, option 'with driver' / 'without driver', lease term. 

5. <span id="reqf_5"></span> The system generates an Invoice, which the client pays. 

6. <span id="reqf_6"></span> The manager reviews the order and may reject it, giving a reason. 

7. <span id="reqf_7"></span> The manager also registers the return of the car, in case of car damage he issues an invoice for repairs through the system. 

8. <span id="reqf_8"></span> The system administrator has the rights: 
   - adding, deleting cars, editing car information; 
   - blocking / unblocking the user; 
   - registration of managers in the system.


## Additional features
As I said in the section "[Introduction](#introduction)", my goal was to make a viable product, which is why it was implemented a lot of interesting functionality, 
such as a separate module of driver management, driver panel, accounting "availability" of certain cars on dates ranges, etc. 

All that stuff is described in more detail in the appropriate categories.

## About new driver system
The new driver system, which was not specified in the requirements, is designed to automate the process of managing drivers and assigning them to orders. 
It allows drivers to manage coupled orders and, for example, to delegate them to other drivers (if the system can find a suitable driver for that order). 

The "rents management panel" for drivers has a useful functionality to work with rents, view statistics and change the city in which the driver works.

This system also allows to prohibit the client to set "with driver" in the order, if no suitable drivers are found.
